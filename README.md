## The FOSS United Platform

Repo for the website and open-source platform of FOSS United. The whole platform is being built on [Frappe](https://frappe.io).

## Installation

- This project works the best on the latest Frappe Version v15. And is suggested to be installed on the same.
- Checkout Frappe Framework [Installation Docs](https://frappeframework.com/docs/) for setting up frappe on your [bench](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/tutorial/install-and-setup-bench).
- If you encounter a password-related error after installing MariaDB while following the Frappe installation guide—despite not setting a password—follow [this DigitalOcean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-reset-your-mysql-or-mariadb-root-password) to reset the root password. If the `kill` command near the end of the article fails, find the MySQL processes using `ps aux | grep mysqld`, identify the `mysqld` and `mysql_safe` processes, and terminate them with `sudo kill -9 <pid>`. Verify that the processes are no longer running before proceeding.
- Create a new bench with
  `bench init fossu-bench`
- Clone the FOSS United Platform App.
  `bench get-app https://github.com/fossunited/fossunited`
- Create a [new site](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/tutorial/create-a-site)
  `bench new-site test.localhost`
- Install the App on the created site
  `bench --site test.localhost install-app fossunited`
- Finally,
  `bench start`

Checkout [Access site in your browser](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/tutorial/create-a-site#access-site-in-your-browser) for adding hosts.
